"""
Model of a Zombie outbreak in France, starting in Grenoble

This is a rewrite from this blog post by Max Berrgren:

http://maxberggren.github.io/2014/11/27/model-of-a-zombie-outbreak/

with a different country, a slightly different model, and different
libraries. The map of population density is taken from Wikimedia Commons

Model
------

I use a modified SIR model. "Modified" because I didn't fully understood
SIR when I wrote the code. The population is divided in 3 categories:

S = Sane people
I = People who have been beaten, theay are Incubating, soon-to-be Zombies
R = Rampaging Zombies

The rules are as follows:
- Sane citizen don't move (the army forbids it) until they get biten
  by a zombie
- Biten people move fast (they don't control themselves) and after
  some time they are tranformed into zombies. As a consequence, some
  cities like Paris will be contaminated by these people, ahead of the
  main zombie wave.
- Zombies walk slowly and bite people.

All units are really much arbitrary and tuned to make a sexy animation.

Result
-------
See the resulting animation here:

Blue represents sane citizen, red zombies, and green/yellow infected
people. Looks like Maubeuge, in the north-east, will (finally) be the
place to go.

Requirements:
-------------

Numpy for numerical computations.
Scipy for the convolution that computes the dispersion
MoviePy for the animation (requires FFMPEG installed)
ImageMagick if you want to make a gif
